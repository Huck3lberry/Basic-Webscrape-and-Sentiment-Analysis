Task:
Build a python scraper to scrape the product pages on https://stackshare.io/ (eg https://stackshare.io/stripe) capturing the data which you think might be useful to evaluate the company. 
You can leave out the data that requires you to be logged in to see it.

On-top of the data build an algorithm to rank the companies by how interesting they’ll likely be from an investment perspective. 
You won’t have sufficient data to build a statistical model, so use your judgement to build a heuristic model that you think might be effective. 
In your comments note what you think are the most interesting factors and why.”

Files:
Webscraper_refactor.py - the script to run for the results 
Stacks_data.csv - results file which is generated by the script above 

Software/Package Requirements:
1. Python3
2. bs4 and BeautifulSoup (pip install beatifulsoup4)
3. Selenium (pip install selenium)
4. vaderSentiment (pip install vaderSentiment and pip install --upgrade vaderSentiment)
5. Firefox browser

Algorithm approach - to extract features which ensembled together form an investment score which ranks the 
companies relative to each other. The individual features are grouped in 3 categories - social media, business 
adoption and sentiment analysis. Each category computes a weighted score of its features.
Then the three category scores are computed as a weighted average to form an investment score of the company 
relative to its peers.The individual weights for the categories are 5% Social media, 60% business adoption 
and 35% sentiment.    

Extracted features:
Social media variables score (weighting towards the category score) - only the stack.io website is used for the
scores, however, followers, votes can be seen as proxies for popularity of a product which can facilitate wider adoption.   
1. Number of Stacks (40%) - reported stacks on the website
2. Number of Followers (40%) - people who follow the respective product
3. Number of votes (20%) - number of submitted votes on the website for a specific product 
Business adoption variables - aims to track how widely adopted is the product by companies and developers.
Integrations can be a powerfull indicator as they frequently require significant efforts to be created which is
a sign of commitment to the product.  
4. Number of Companies (33.33%) - reported number of companies who use the product
5. Number of Developers (33.33%) - reported number of developers who use the product
6. Number of Integrations (33.34%) - reported number of integrations of a product
Sentiment Analysis variables: aims to extract the sentiment of key stakeholders who have shared their 
opinion about a product in the comments section. Offers potential to gain insight outside of the usual business metrics. 
7. Negative - negative sentiment score
8. Neutral - neutral sentiment score
9. Positive - positive sentiment score
10. Compound - a combination of 7,8 and 9 which can be used individually to determine the sentiment 
note: the sentiment score is formed only by the Compound feature (7,8 and 9 are ignored for the algorithm)

    Sentiment Analysis score readings for compound score only.   
    positive sentiment: compound score >= 0.05
    neutral sentiment: (compound score > -0.05) and (compound score < 0.05)
    negative sentiment: compound score <= -0.05
